\title{Create Classification Plots for TE Expression}
\usage{
graph_classify_TE(
  res,
  plot.title = NULL,
  device = "png",
  width.pie = 14,
  height.pie = 7,
  width.bar = 7,
  height.bar = 7,
  output_folder = ".",
  colors = c(dependent = "#FF1F5B", self = "#009ADE"),
  labels = c(dependent = "Gene-dependent TEs", self = "Self-expressed TEs"),
  save = "all"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{Data frame containing TE classification results. Must include
columns: \code{TE_expression} (classification: "dependent" or "self"),
and \code{expression_type} (detailed classification for stacked bar plots).}

\item{plot.title}{Character string. Title for the plot. If NULL (default),
no title is displayed.}

\item{device}{Character vector. File format(s) for output plots. Supported:
"pdf", "svg", "eps", "png", "tiff", "jpeg". Default is "png".}

\item{width.pie}{Numeric. Plot width in inches for pie graph. Default is 14 (suitable for
4-6 TE classes).}

\item{height.pie}{Numeric. Plot height in inches for pie graph. Default is 7.}

\item{width.bar}{Numeric. Plot width in inches for stack. Default is 7 (suitable for
4-6 TE classes).}

\item{height.bar}{Numeric. Plot height in inches for stack bar. Default is 7.}

\item{output_folder}{Character string. Directory where plots will be saved.
Default is current directory (".").}

\item{colors}{Named character vector. Colors for TE expression types.
Default is c("dependent" = "#FF1F5B", "self" = "#009ADE"). Names must
match values in \code{TE_expression} column.}

\item{labels}{Named character vector. Labels for TE expression types in
legend. Default is c("dependent" = "Gene-dependent TEs",
"self" = "Self-expressed TEs").}

\item{save}{Character string. Which TEs to save in output file:
\itemize{
\item "all": All expressed TEs (default)
\item "dys": Only significantly dysregulated TEs (up or down)
\item "up": Only significantly upregulated TEs
\item "down": Only significantly downregulated TEs
}

The function creates three types of plots:

\strong{1. Pie Charts:}
One pie chart per TE class showing the overall proportion of:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Self-expressed TEs}: Transcribed from their own promoter
\item \strong{Gene-dependent TEs}: Transcribed as part of gene runthrough
}

\strong{2. Stacked Bar Charts:}
Grouped bars showing detailed classification breakdown:
\itemize{
\item Exon, Intron (expressed), Intron (not expressed), etc.
\item Grouped by self-expressed vs. gene-dependent
\item One panel per TE class
}

\strong{3. Bar plot:}
One bar per TE class showing the overall proportion and absolute number of
TE elements en each class.}
}
\value{
Invisible NULL. Called for side effects (creating plot files).
}
\description{
Generates multiple types of plots showing the proportion of self-expressed
vs. gene-dependent transposable elements across different TE classes (LINE,
SINE, LTR, DNA, etc.).
