\title{Create Antisense TE GTF with Both Strands}
\usage{
gtfBothStrands(gtf.file, output.file = NULL, add_suffix = "_AS")
}
\arguments{
\item{gtf.file}{Character string. Path to input TE GTF file. The file will be
read, duplicated with strand inversion, and exported to a new file with
"_AS" suffix.}

\item{output.file}{Character string. Optional path for output TE GTF file. If
NULL (default), creates a file in the same directory as input with "_AS"
added before the extension (e.g., "hg38_rmsk_TE.gtf" becomes
"hg38_rmsk_TE_AS.gtf").}

\item{add_suffix}{Character string. Suffix to add to gene_id and
transcript_id for antisense features. Default is "_AS".}
}
\value{
Character string (invisibly). Path to the created output GTF file.
Also prints a message with file location and feature counts.
}
\description{
Generates a GTF file containing both sense and antisense annotations by
duplicating all features and inverting the strand for antisense copies.
Useful for analyzing antisense transcription or bidirectional promoters.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Imports the input TE GTF file
\item Creates antisense copies by inverting strand information
\item Appends suffix to gene_id and transcript_id in antisense copies
\item Merges sense and antisense features
\item Sorts by genomic coordinates
\item Exports to new TE GTF file
}

For each feature on the "+" strand, an antisense copy on the "-" strand is
created, and vice versa. Gene and transcript IDs are modified to distinguish
antisense features (e.g., "ENSG00000000001" becomes "ENSG00000000001_AS").
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create antisense GTF with default naming
gtfBothStrands("genes.gtf")
# Output: genes_AS.gtf

# Specify custom output file
gtfBothStrands(
  gtf.file = "hg38_rmsk_TE.gtf",
  output.file = "hg38_rmsk_TE_AS.gtf"
)

# Custom suffix for antisense features
gtfBothStrands(
  gtf.file = "hg38_rmsk_TE.gtf",
  add_suffix = "_antisense"
)
}

}
