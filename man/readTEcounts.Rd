\title{Read and Merge TE Count Data by Sample}
\usage{
readTEcounts(metadata, folder)
}
\arguments{
\item{metadata}{Data frame with sample metadata, as returned by
\code{\link{read_metadata}}. Must contain columns: File, Sample, Group,
and Condition.}

\item{folder}{Character string. Path to the directory containing the count
files listed in the first column of \code{metadata}. Can be absolute or
relative path.}
}
\value{
A data frame with features as row names and samples as columns.
Column names correspond to the Sample column in \code{metadata}.
Column order matches the row order in \code{metadata}.
}
\description{
Reads transposable element (TE) count files for multiple samples and merges
them into a single count matrix. Count files from TElocal (TEtranscripts)
should be tab-separated with two columns: feature names and counts.
}
\details{
Each count file must:
\itemize{
\item Be tab-separated
\item Have a header row
\item Contain exactly 2 columns: feature name and count value
\item Use the same feature names across all samples (order can vary)
}

The function attempts to efficiently merge count data:
\itemize{
\item If all files have identical features in the same order, uses fast
column binding
\item If feature order differs, performs full outer join to align features
\item Missing features in some samples are filled with NA (should not occur
in well-formatted data)
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Read metadata
metadata <- read_metadata("metadata.txt")

# Read count files from directory
countData <- readTEcounts(metadata, folder = "counts")

# Verify dimensions
dim(countData)
head(countData)
}

}
