\title{Get Results After DESeq2 Analysis}
\usage{
results_deseq2(dds, shrinklog2FC)
}
\arguments{
\item{dds}{A DESeqDataSet object as returned by \code{\link{call_deseq2}} or
\code{DESeq2::DESeq()}. Must have completed the DESeq2 analysis pipeline.}

\item{shrinklog2FC}{Logical. If TRUE, applies log2 fold change shrinkage using
the apeglm method to produce more accurate effect size estimates. If FALSE,
returns standard DESeq2 results. Default is FALSE. Note: Shrinkage requires
the \code{apeglm} package to be installed.}
}
\value{
A data frame with DESeq2 results with rows sorted by adjusted p-value
(most significant first). Row names correspond to feature names from the count data.
}
\description{
Extracts differential expression results from a DESeqDataSet object,
with optional log2 fold change shrinkage for improved effect size estimates.
}
\details{
This function extracts differential expression results comparing the "Treat"
condition against the "Control" condition (reference level).

When \code{shrinklog2FC = TRUE}, log2 fold changes are shrunk using the
apeglm method (\code{DESeq2::lfcShrink})

Rows with NA values (typically low-count genes filtered by DESeq2's
independent filtering) are removed, and results are sorted by adjusted p-value.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Run DESeq2 analysis
dds <- call_deseq2(countData, metadata, useCtrlGenes = FALSE)

# Get results without shrinkage
res <- results_deseq2(dds, shrinklog2FC = FALSE)

# Get results with log2FC shrinkage (requires apeglm package)
res_shrink <- results_deseq2(dds, shrinklog2FC = TRUE)

# View top results
head(res)
}
