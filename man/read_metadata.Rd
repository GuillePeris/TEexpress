\title{Read Metadata File with Sample Information}
\usage{
read_metadata(datafile)
}
\arguments{
\item{datafile}{Character string. Path to a tab-separated file (.txt, .tsv, or .csv)
containing metadata. Must have exactly 4 columns with headers: File, Sample,
Group, and Condition.}
}
\value{
A data frame with four columns (File, Sample, Group, Condition) and
validated metadata. The Condition column is converted to a factor with
"Control" as the reference level.
}
\description{
Reads and validates a tab-separated metadata file containing sample information
for differential expression analysis. The file must contain specific columns
and follow formatting requirements for DESeq2 compatibility.
}
\details{
The metadata file must follow these requirements:
\itemize{
\item Exactly 4 columns with headers: File, Sample, Group, Condition
\item At least one row of data (beyond the header)
\item The "Condition" column must contain exactly two unique values: "Control" and "Treat"
\item No duplicate values in the "Sample" or "File" columns
\item Tab-separated format (other delimiters not supported)
}

The "Control" and "Treat" labels in the Condition column are required for
proper DESeq2 analysis, where "Control" will be set as the reference level.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Read metadata from file
metadata <- read_metadata("path/to/metadata.txt")

# Example valid file structure:
# File            Sample  Group   Condition
# WT1.cntTable    WT1     WT      Control
# WT2.cntTable    WT2     WT      Control
# KO1.cntTable    KO1     KO      Treat
# KO2.cntTable    KO2     KO      Treat
}
